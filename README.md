# Face Recognition using Transfer learning
Face recognition falls into 2 categories:

Face verification - check if the person is the correct one (passport verification at the airport).

Face Identification – Who is the person?

Transfer Learning – 2 types of transfer learning:

Fine tuning - Replace a trained neural network’s fully connected layer head and then train

Feature extraction (best suited for face recognition) - Pre-trained neural network serves as a feature extractor.
Allow the input to propagate forward and taking the output from specific layer
